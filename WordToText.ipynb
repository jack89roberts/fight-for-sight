      "This project will address the challenge of scarring of the cornea, which blinds 10 million people worldwide. Therapeutic corneal transplantation is limited by the global shortage of suitable donor tissue and high risk of tissue rejection and is not applicable to all disorders.  Stem cell therapy has the potential to address this significant unmet clinical need.  Availability of large banks of allogeneic stem cells (that the recipient does not reject) for direct use as a therapy or for tissue engineering would be ideal, however, autologous solutions may be feasible in the short term.  Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are especially promising due to their reported immune-modulatory capacity to delay the host rejection of allogeneic tissue in human recipients.  A population of MSC-like cells, called Corneal Stromal Stem Cells (CSSC), reside in the corneal limbus and can be made to differentiate into keratocytes (which maintain healthy transparent corneal stroma).  Promisingly, human CSSC were not rejected when transplanted into murine corneas and were able to reduce haze.   We will use our tissue engineering expertise to develop methods for delivery of CSSC to patients.  Specifically we will compare our novel collagen-based, GMP compliant ‘RAFT’ technology and a rapidly degradable fibrin-based hydrogel.  We propose that CSSC will bring benefit to patients with limbal epithelial stem cell deficiency induced haze (within 2 years of project completion) and those with corneal scarring from other causes (within 5 years of project completion) by providing a tissue equivalent (TE) incorporating CSSC or keratocytes depending upon clinical need.\n",

TITLE OF PROJECTThe structural basis for Peripherin Function; Reversing its dysfunction in natural disease.4. ABSTRACT OF RESEARCH PROJECTThis project will build on a highly successful previous \"Fight for Sight\" studentship whichestablished the function of the rod disc protein \"peripherin\"2,the effect on this role of naturalmutations ^which give rise to retinitis pigmentosa2 and the topography of the protein in themembrane3.

DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH FOR I.AY TRUSTEES(including the relevance of the proposed project to the charity's aims of prevention and treatment of blindness)Mutations in the rod disc protein \"peripherin\" have been shown to be associated with certainforms of retinitis pigmentosa, they give rise to retinal degeneration causing blindness in bothhuman and experimental animals.

To help understand the mechanism of action of the protein in moredetail, we aim to uncover the structure of key regions in the protein mainly responsible for thisrole and the importance of specific amino acid residues for its form and function. This may alsoaid the discovery of new drugs. Patentable material could result from this research.Fight for Sight, Institute of Ophthalmology, Bath Street, lrndon EC1V gEL, Tel 020 7608 4000.

      "PROPOSED PROJECTDescription of the proposed project, including purpose and background, plan of investigation, methods andtechniques, and relevant references. Please do not exceed two sides in length.I PreambleThe last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on the molecular description of disease and inharnessing the information present in the genome to the development of new therapeuticregimes. Treating human conditions will increasingly be a process of target identification,target characterisation and target intervention. In these respects genetic diseases ofvision are atthe forefront. The key molecular components of vision are for the most part known. Thus targetidentification is readily achieved: not so, however, target characterisation and even lesstherapeutic intervention. This project is directed at these latter two aspects in the hope that theremay be ways of treating individuals which does not depend on gene therapy. tn carrying out thisproject, the student will not only become more aware of human suffering but also be equippedwith the approaches and experimental skills to make a meaningful contribution to improvementof the human condition.2 Introduction and BackgroundThis project will largely be concerned with increasing our understanding of \"peripherin\", aprotein located in the membrane of the retinal rod disc. It has been known for some time thatnatural mutations of this polypeptide are closely associated with some forms of retinitispigmentosal but the role of the protein was unclear. In an award from \"Fight for Sight\", wehave been able to experimentally mimic the role of peripherin in vitro and in the process notonly establish its function but also demonstrate the effect of a variety of mutations in theprotein2. None of the mutations were able to produce this \"molecular velcro - like\" action. Wehypothesise that this is achieved by some form of self-association primarily involving the largeintra-discal loop seen in the a@ompanying figure. Interestingly, some of the milder forms of thedisease seen with some mutations correlated with less pronounced flattening of the populationof membrane vesicles, suggesting that the mutant protein was either in a folded form whichpreserved, albeit weakly, some of its native functionality or that it was in an unstableequilibrium between correctly and incorrectly folded states.The structure, even the basic topological delineation of the polypeptide chain in the lipidbilayer, was only the subject of conjecture but, using a glycosylation approach, we have nowdetermined its topology and in the process established the basis for another natural mutation3and the location of the key interacting loop. In this case, a double glycosylation event disruptedthe native function of the protein reinforcing the postulate outlined above that the structure ofthe large loop is responsible for some of the functional features of the protein. And moreover,that this function involved self association in some way, since no other proteins specific to thevisual system were in our assay. The study also demonstrated the essential role of a disulphidebond2.3 ObjectivesThe overall aims are (I) to obtain a better understanding of the molecular details of the role ofthe large extra membranous loop in the function of the protein, (ii) investigate structural detailsof the protein relevant to this role and (iii) identify chemical compounds that may restorefunctionality.Specifically, we intend to:-3.7 Determine the quatemary organisation of the expressed protein and the behaviour ofnatural mutants in this respect.3.2 Generate constructs of the large extra membranous loop which seems to be key to thefunction of the protein such that they can be produced in large amounts and subjected tostructural and functional analysis.3.3 lnvestigate the role of the intramembranous domain and use new techniques intryptophan phosphorescence to determine the structure (helices?), sidedness (ipidfacing?) and role of the 4 regions of the protein.3.4 Use the invitro assay to establish whether compounds may restore the native function ofnatural mutants of peripherin.J\n",

      "4 Experimental4.1 Oligomeric Structure - Current indications are that interactions between individualsubunits of peripherin give rise to an oligomeric complex which in tum is responsible for thefunctionality of the protein. Our previous work suggested that a disulphide bond was importantin complex formation. Here we intend to investigate this oligomeric process using the in vitroexpression system that revealed the role of the protein. New constructs of the protein will becreated which contain molecular tags (FLAG, His6, FIA) which can be used for purification andimmunological identification. They will be expressed in various combinations and the studywill determine the oligomerisation process by establishing whether and which \"tagged\" versionsof the protein co-punfy. For example, if the His tag is used in Ni-NTA affinity purification doesthe FlAG-tagged peripherin co- purify ? If so this would indicate interactions between the two.The study would be extended to include other version of peripherin, its native homologueROM1 and importantly, natural disease-related mutants. This would identify the prefenedcomposition and size of the natural complex and determine whether the key effect of mutation isto destroy complex formation. By incorporating a variety of mutants with the wildtype gene itwill be possible to draw up a list of dominant and recessive mutants in terms of vesicleflattening which should conelate with the genetic descriptions.4.2 Stntctural Aspects of Periphertn - There looks to be two key regions of the protein, alarge extra membranous \"loop\" which contains most of the natural mutations, and a substantialembedded membrane domain whose real role is obscure. It is intended to explore the structureof both these regions in distinct ways.4.2(l It is proposed to express the large ca l50-residue loop in quantities that will allowbiophysical characterisation. A variety of expression systems (E. Coli, yeast, large scale in vitro- Roche, insect larval cells) and constructs (+/- leader sequences, small hydrophobic linkers)will be explored to maximise recovery levels. We have had some suc@ss along these lines withwater-soluble domains of ion channels. The expressed material will be examined forfunctionality (dimerisation, oligomerisation?) and subjected to NMR analysis and crystallisationtrials (facilities available on site). Natural mutations could then be examined in a similarfashion using techniques such as CD to reveal quickly whether they are miss-folded.4.2(ii) The intra membranous domain remains an enigma. If functionality is vested only in thelarge loop then four trans-membrane domains are largely superfluous - one could suffice. It isproposed, therefore, to examine in the first instance both the organisation and role of the trans-membrane segments. This will involve a mutagenic study in conjunction with the assay foroligomerisation developed in Section 4.1. Mutations will be carried out which are conservativein nature (eg the alteration or interchange of transmembrane (TM) segrnents rather than changesin their hydrophobic character) but which are likely nonetheless to disrupt any specific inter- orintra-molecular interactions. [n a similar way the role of rather distinctive residues (eg chargedGlu in TM4) in the folding and assembly of the complex will be examined by both conservativeand radical (ie change of character) mutations. Both these studies should reveal the role andidentity of regions crucial to the folding and assembly process.The study can be developed to ask questions about the structure (ie are they helical?)and orientation (ie exposed to the lipid bilayer or within the structure / complex?) of theseregions using a very new, highly sensitive approach based on monitoring the quenching oftryptophan fluorescence or phosphorescence by small probes which partition with the lipidbilayer.4.3 Potential Therapeutic Agents - The work already published allows us to address thepossibility of discovering agents that might be therapeutically beneficial. This part of the studyis constructed largely in the form of a demonstrator project. It is proposed to examine the abilityof specific agents and combinatorial libraries to restore the vesicle flattening functionality tonatural mutations. The first mutation to explore is the doubly glycosylated one3. We alreadyhave evidence that single glycosylation is not important to the function of the protein. So wewould now examine whether any of a range of glycosylation inhibitors are able to producevesicle flattening. This would indicate that the second glycosylation event alters theconformation of the interacting loop region or obscures a critical interaction site. Either way,4\n",
      "\n",
      "success immediately opens up a therapeutic regime to individuals carrying that particularmutation. Our second range of compounds would be those which facilitate disulphide bondformation. This is critical to the activity of peripherin2 and by forcing its formation in thefolding process, one may \"trap\" the active conformation. Finally, we will expose variousmutants to large chemical combinatorial libraries produced in Ireds for other protein projects,to examine whether it is practically possible to restore functionality. The \"unstable\" mutantsRI72G or W might be quite useful in this respect since they appear to show some form ofequilibrium between the correctly and incorrectly folded states and one may be able to force theequilibrium in the correctly folded direction. It is not really practical to suggest that we willidentify any specific effective agent. lnstead this aspect is designed to test, with a huge mixtureof compounds and several mutants, whether restoration of functionality is feasible. Anyindications of success would be enormously exciting, considering the ease of application andrelative safety of any resulting medication.References1 Farrar G J, Kenna P, Jordan S A, Kumar-Singh R, Humphries M M, Sharp E M, SchielsD M, & Humphries P.

      "BACKGROUND IIIFORMATIONDescription of the Department/insfitution, to include previous experience in vision research, current grant supportfor vision research, relevant collaborative projects and basic research resources available (1 side).The Astbury Centre for Structural Biology is a multi-disciplinary Research Centre which is partof the integrated Faculty of Biological Sciences, recently graded 5 in the RAE exercise. It has avery substantial portfolio of research awards to intemationally-recognised Research Groups. Itis particularly strong in membrane research where members are part of 3 separate MRC Co-operatives and in Structural Molecular Biology (NMR, X-ray Crystallography, ElectronMicroscopy) where it is a special BBSRC International Centre and EU Training Site. Researchin the Faculty is organised into recognised Research Sections and there is a strong tradition ofcollaboration both within and between Research Sections. The applicant is a member of boththe Membrane and Structural Research Centres. Both these aspects figure significantly in theproject proposed in this application.Being a major Centre for Research particularly in the field of membranes and proteins, theFaculty possesses all the necessary equipment and expertise to facilitate research in these areas.ln particular, there has been major investment in scientifically experienced senior laboratorymanagers to run, on a daily basis, NMR, X-ray, EM, Mass Spectrometry, Protein Sequencing,analysis and peptide synthesis facilities. This is a major aid to the training of our youngscientists.This laboratory has its origins in the visual field and was one of two major groups who reportedthe first full sequence of rhodopsin. Further work on phosphorylation sites and on the proteinchemistry of the visual receptor produced the first model not only of rhodopsin but of a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) - (see Findlay and Pappin (1986) Biochem. J 238,625-642).The recent publication of the X-ray structure for the protein revealed that as well as being thefirst model, it was also the only one which predicted most of the key features of the receptor.Work on the visual system has continued ever since mostly concentrating on the cloning andanalysis of components in the squid visual system, which like the giant axon has told us muchabout mammalian components such as the Trp ion channel, important in signal transduction andin the structure of the photoreceptor membrane. Work with rhodopsin has also spread out intoother GPCRs where we are an internationally recognised group in the area of the structure andfunction of these membrane receptors. We also have major projects on the vacuolar membraneFf-ATPase. Finally, our discovery several years ago that retinol is taken up by cells, especiallyin the retina, via a novel membrane receptor has recently been validated by cloning andtransgenic experiments from other groups, and has facilitated a new programme of work inthese visually important receptor systems.Our particular contribution has been on the protein chemistry of these molecules in conjunctionwith techniques in molecular biology. This expertise has now become particularly germane inthe relatively new field of proteomics where we now run an advanced centre for high-throughput analysis (including sequencing and mass spectrometry) particularly directed atmembrane systems and human disease.As can be seen from this outline, our laboratory is organised into several interactive researchteams each involved in a specific research area and populated by a combination of post-doctoraland post-graduate students. I meet these groups regularly on a collective basis but also haveone-two hour meetings every few weeks with each scientist individually to discuss progress,problems and the next experiments. I encourage and provide support for students to attendappropriate National and lnternational Conferences and through my contacts spend shortperiods of time in colleagues' laboratories, particularly abroad. Students have recently workedin the USA,Italy, Belgium, Germany and France.6\n",

      "TRAININGDescription of the training prograrnme for the PhD student, to include: mechanisms for monitoring progress,availability oftaught courses, practice at presentations etc (1 side).Facultv Graduate School and trainingPostgraduate training in the Faculty of Biological Sciences is coordinated by a central FacultyGraduate Office. The Graduate School offers specific training courses on research techniques,experimental design and data assessment, research environment, use of IT and the businessenvironment. The university's Staff and Department Development Unit offers a range oftraining courses in communication skills, interpersonal skills and personal effectiveness. Acomplete list of more than 50 training courses that are currently on offer can be found on theGraduate S chool Web page (http ://www.fbs.leeds. ac.uk/gradschooU).Monitoring student prosressStudents are selected on the basis of a CV, standard application forms and interviews with staffmembers and the Admission Tutor. Formal meetings between supervisor and the student takeplace once a month, with a written record that is filed centrally; the student prepares a report ofprogress, problems and future work, which is discussed with the supervisor and commentsadded. All students additionally have an academic staff advisor who is an independent, andconfidential, source of advice and guidance. Students register provisionally for the PhD degreeand progress is monitored by frequent informal meetings and by the monthly formal meetingsystem.Assessment of studentsDuring the flust year the student gives at least one poster or oral presentation. Project reports arewritten at 4 months and 9 months. The 9 months report is examined orally by a panel ofassessors, who on the basis of the report and viva decide about transfer to full PhD registration.ln years 2 and3 students give formal seminars that are assessed by two staff who providewritten feedback and advice. At the end of year 2 students prepare a further report including aplan for completing their thesis within 3 years. This is discussed with their supervisor andadvisor who provide appropriate feedback and advice. Industrial links have been established andas an example, some of the third year symposia are sponsored by Organon Ltd. who haveprovided prizes for the best oral presentations. All students are encouraged to submit theirthesis by the end of the third year. The University has an absolute 4 year submissionguillotine. Perhaps, not surprisingly, our completion rates are particularly high!Scientific developmentEach year, students will attend at least 10 research seminars glven by internal or externalspeakers. Attendance is recorded at seminars, courses and conferences in the sfudentsPersonal Profile folder throughout their 3 years. Students are encouraged to attend BBSRCGraduate Schools, national and international scientific conferences. Each year there is a prizecompetition in the Faculty sponsored by Novartis to provide funding for the winning studentto attend an international conference during their final year.Laboratory EnvironmentAs outlined above, previous work in this area has set up the assay systems in a way that willgreatly facilitate this new prograrnme of work. Since this is a laboratory largely devoted to thestudy of structure/function relationships of integral membrane proteins using recombinant DNAand protein chemical technologies, this project will be carried out in a very supportive andknowledgeable environment. It is appreciated that this is a large and in some parts veryambitious project and unlikely to be realised in full by a single PhD student. However, it ishoped that exposure to some of the techniques, aspects and potential of the study will generate ahighly and appropriately trained scientist motivated by the problems of human disease.7\n",

      "Structural molecular biology plays a pivotal role in modern biology, both in the fundamentalunderstanding of living things and in the design of new treatments for disease.The NeedRetinitis PiqmentosaRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the name given to a group of hereditary eye disorders affecting theretina, (the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye) in which the first stages of seeing takeplace, ln RP, sight loss is gradual but progressive.The retina serves a similar purpose to a film inside a camera. Light is focused by a lens at thefront of the camera onto a light-sensitive film at the back, to form a picture, ln a similar way, lightentering the eye is focused onto a light-sensitive tissue which lines the inside of the eye at theback. This tissue is the retina.The retina consists of two main layers, a thin one called the pigment epithelium and a thickerone, made up of many layers of cells, called the neural retina, One particular layer in this neuralretina contains many millions of cells (called photoreceptors) which are able to respond to light. Afew million cells called cones are concentrated in the central portion of the retina, These allow theeye to see fine detail and colour. Away from the central portion of the retina are about 120 millioncells, which are mostly rod cells. They enable us to see when light is dim and provide peripheralvision outside of the main line of sight, When light is focused onto these rods or cones, a smallelectrical charge is generated (the amount depends on the amount of light) and this chargepasses down the optic nerve to the brain. As each of these cells receives a slightly differentamount of light and sends a different electrical pulse, the brain is able to assemble a picture,It is now known that there are many different inherited defects causing RP, ln all RP-relatedconditions however, the ability of the retina to respond to light is affected. The problem can be inmany parts of the retina such as the rod or cone cells, or in the connections between the cells ofthe retina.The most common first symptom is difficulty in seeing in poor light, for example outdoors at dusk,or in a dimly lit room, A second symptom is reduction of the visual field, in which sight is lost fromthe sides, or from above and below. This is often referred to as tunnel vision and means that therod cells, and some of the outer cone cells, have been affected first. ln some RP-relatedconditions central vision is lost first, The first signs of this are difficulty in reading print or carryingout detailed work, All RP conditions are progressive, but the speed at which deterioration takesplace varies from one person to another, ln many types of RP, glare from bright lights is anincreasing problem, although some people do not experience this until the more advancedstages,\n",

Please do not exceed two sides in length.I PreambleThe last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on the molecular description of disease and inharnessing the information present in the genome to the development of new therapeuticregimes. Treating human conditions will increasingly be a process of target identification,target characterisation and target intervention. In these respects genetic diseases ofvision are atthe forefront. The key molecular components of vision are for the most part known. Thus targetidentification is readily achieved: not so, however, target characterisation and even lesstherapeutic intervention. This project is directed at these latter two aspects in the hope that theremay be ways of treating individuals which does not depend on gene therapy. tn carrying out thisproject, the student will not only become more aware of human suffering but also be equippedwith the approaches and experimental skills to make a meaningful contribution to improvementof the human condition.2 Introduction and BackgroundThis project will largely be concerned with increasing our understanding of \"peripherin\", aprotein located in the membrane of the retinal rod disc. It has been known for some time thatnatural mutations of this polypeptide are closely associated with some forms of retinitispigmentosal but the role of the protein was unclear. In an award from \"Fight for Sight\", wehave been able to experimentally mimic the role of peripherin in vitro and in the process notonly establish its function but also demonstrate the effect of a variety of mutations in theprotein2. None of the mutations were able to produce this \"molecular velcro - like\" action. Wehypothesise that this is achieved by some form of self-association primarily involving the largeintra-discal loop seen in the a@ompanying figure. Interestingly, some of the milder forms of thedisease seen with some mutations correlated with less pronounced flattening of the populationof membrane vesicles, suggesting that the mutant protein was either in a folded form whichpreserved, albeit weakly, some of its native functionality or that it was in an unstableequilibrium between correctly and incorrectly folded states.The structure, even the basic topological delineation of the polypeptide chain in the lipidbilayer, was only the subject of conjecture but, using a glycosylation approach, we have nowdetermined its topology and in the process established the basis for another natural mutation3and the location of the key interacting loop. In this case, a double glycosylation event disruptedthe native function of the protein reinforcing the postulate outlined above that the structure ofthe large loop is responsible for some of the functional features of the protein. And moreover,that this function involved self association in some way, since no other proteins specific to thevisual system were in our assay. The study also demonstrated the essential role of a disulphidebond2.3 ObjectivesThe overall aims are (I) to obtain a better understanding of the molecular details of the role ofthe large extra membranous loop in the function of the protein, (ii) investigate structural detailsof the protein relevant to this role and (iii) identify chemical compounds that may restorefunctionality.Specifically, we intend to:-3.7 Determine the quatemary organisation of the expressed protein and the behaviour ofnatural mutants in this respect.3.2 Generate constructs of the large extra membranous loop which seems to be key to thefunction of the protein such that they can be produced in large amounts and subjected tostructural and functional analysis.3.3 lnvestigate the role of the intramembranous domain and use new techniques intryptophan phosphorescence to determine the structure (helices?), sidedness (ipidfacing?) and role of the 4 regions of the protein.3.4 Use the invitro assay to establish whether compounds may restore the native function ofnatural mutants of peripherin.J\\n4 Experimental4.1 Oligomeric Structure - Current indications are that interactions between individualsubunits of peripherin give rise to an oligomeric complex which in tum is responsible for thefunctionality of the protein. Our previous work suggested that a disulphide bond was importantin complex formation. Here we intend to investigate this oligomeric process using the in vitroexpression system that revealed the role of the protein. New constructs of the protein will becreated which contain molecular tags (FLAG, His6, FIA) which can be used for purification andimmunological identification. They will be expressed in various combinations and the studywill determine the oligomerisation process by establishing whether and which \"tagged\" versionsof the protein co-punfy. For example, if the His tag is used in Ni-NTA affinity purification doesthe FlAG-tagged peripherin co- purify ? If so this would indicate interactions between the two.The study would be extended to include other version of peripherin, its native homologueROM1 and importantly, natural disease-related mutants. This would identify the prefenedcomposition and size of the natural complex and determine whether the key effect of mutation isto destroy complex formation. By incorporating a variety of mutants with the wildtype gene itwill be possible to draw up a list of dominant and recessive mutants in terms of vesicleflattening which should conelate with the genetic descriptions.4.2 Stntctural Aspects of Periphertn - There looks to be two key regions of the protein, alarge extra membranous \"loop\" which contains most of the natural mutations, and a substantialembedded membrane domain whose real role is obscure. It is intended to explore the structureof both these regions in distinct ways.4.2(l It is proposed to express the large ca l50-residue loop in quantities that will allowbiophysical characterisation. A variety of expression systems (E. Coli, yeast, large scale in vitro- Roche, insect larval cells) and constructs (+/- leader sequences, small hydrophobic linkers)will be explored to maximise recovery levels. We have had some suc@ss along these lines withwater-soluble domains of ion channels. The expressed material will be examined forfunctionality (dimerisation, oligomerisation?) and subjected to NMR analysis and crystallisationtrials (facilities available on site). Natural mutations could then be examined in a similarfashion using techniques such as CD to reveal quickly whether they are miss-folded.4.2(ii) The intra membranous domain remains an enigma. If functionality is vested only in thelarge loop then four trans-membrane domains are largely superfluous - one could suffice. It isproposed, therefore, to examine in the first instance both the organisation and role of the trans-membrane segments. This will involve a mutagenic study in conjunction with the assay foroligomerisation developed in Section 4.1. Mutations will be carried out which are conservativein nature (eg the alteration or interchange of transmembrane (TM) segrnents rather than changesin their hydrophobic character) but which are likely nonetheless to disrupt any specific inter- orintra-molecular interactions. [n a similar way the role of rather distinctive residues (eg chargedGlu in TM4) in the folding and assembly of the complex will be examined by both conservativeand radical (ie change of character) mutations. Both these studies should reveal the role andidentity of regions crucial to the folding and assembly process.The study can be developed to ask questions about the structure (ie are they helical?)and orientation (ie exposed to the lipid bilayer or within the structure / complex?) of theseregions using a very new, highly sensitive approach based on monitoring the quenching oftryptophan fluorescence or phosphorescence by small probes which partition with the lipidbilayer.4.3 Potential Therapeutic Agents - The work already published allows us to address thepossibility of discovering agents that might be therapeutically beneficial. This part of the studyis constructed largely in the form of a demonstrator project. It is proposed to examine the abilityof specific agents and combinatorial libraries to restore the vesicle flattening functionality tonatural mutations. The first mutation to explore is the doubly glycosylated one3. We alreadyhave evidence that single glycosylation is not important to the function of the protein. So wewould now examine whether any of a range of glycosylation inhibitors are able to producevesicle flattening. This would indicate that the second glycosylation event alters theconformation of the interacting loop region or obscures a critical interaction site. Either way,4\\nsuccess immediately opens up a therapeutic regime to individuals carrying that particularmutation. Our second range of compounds would be those which facilitate disulphide bondformation. This is critical to the activity of peripherin2 and by forcing its formation in thefolding process, one may \"trap\" the active conformation. Finally, we will expose variousmutants to large chemical combinatorial libraries produced in Ireds for other protein projects,to examine whether it is practically possible to restore functionality. The \"unstable\" mutantsRI72G or W might be quite useful in this respect since they appear to show some form ofequilibrium between the correctly and incorrectly folded states and one may be able to force theequilibrium in the correctly folded direction. It is not really practical to suggest that we willidentify any specific effective agent. lnstead this aspect is designed to test, with a huge mixtureof compounds and several mutants, whether restoration of functionality is feasible. Anyindications of success would be enormously exciting, considering the ease of application andrelative safety of any resulting medication.References1 Farrar G J, Kenna P, Jordan S A, Kumar-Singh R, Humphries M M, Sharp E M, SchielsD M, & Humphries P.

It has avery substantial portfolio of research awards to intemationally-recognised Research Groups. Itis particularly strong in membrane research where members are part of 3 separate MRC Co-operatives and in Structural Molecular Biology (NMR, X-ray Crystallography, ElectronMicroscopy) where it is a special BBSRC International Centre and EU Training Site. Researchin the Faculty is organised into recognised Research Sections and there is a strong tradition ofcollaboration both within and between Research Sections. The applicant is a member of boththe Membrane and Structural Research Centres. Both these aspects figure significantly in theproject proposed in this application.Being a major Centre for Research particularly in the field of membranes and proteins, theFaculty possesses all the necessary equipment and expertise to facilitate research in these areas.ln particular, there has been major investment in scientifically experienced senior laboratorymanagers to run, on a daily basis, NMR, X-ray, EM, Mass Spectrometry, Protein Sequencing,analysis and peptide synthesis facilities. This is a major aid to the training of our youngscientists.This laboratory has its origins in the visual field and was one of two major groups who reportedthe first full sequence of rhodopsin. Further work on phosphorylation sites and on the proteinchemistry of the visual receptor produced the first model not only of rhodopsin but of a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) - (see Findlay and Pappin (1986) Biochem. J 238,625-642).The recent publication of the X-ray structure for the protein revealed that as well as being thefirst model, it was also the only one which predicted most of the key features of the receptor.Work on the visual system has continued ever since mostly concentrating on the cloning andanalysis of components in the squid visual system, which like the giant axon has told us muchabout mammalian components such as the Trp ion channel, important in signal transduction andin the structure of the photoreceptor membrane. Work with rhodopsin has also spread out intoother GPCRs where we are an internationally recognised group in the area of the structure andfunction of these membrane receptors. We also have major projects on the vacuolar membraneFf-ATPase. Finally, our discovery several years ago that retinol is taken up by cells, especiallyin the retina, via a novel membrane receptor has recently been validated by cloning andtransgenic experiments from other groups, and has facilitated a new programme of work inthese visually important receptor systems.Our particular contribution has been on the protein chemistry of these molecules in conjunctionwith techniques in molecular biology. This expertise has now become particularly germane inthe relatively new field of proteomics where we now run an advanced centre for high-throughput analysis (including sequencing and mass spectrometry) particularly directed atmembrane systems and human disease.As can be seen from this outline, our laboratory is organised into several interactive researchteams each involved in a specific research area and populated by a combination of post-doctoraland post-graduate students. I meet these groups regularly on a collective basis but also haveone-two hour meetings every few weeks with each scientist individually to discuss progress,problems and the next experiments. I encourage and provide support for students to attendappropriate National and lnternational Conferences and through my contacts spend shortperiods of time in colleagues\\' laboratories, particularly abroad. Students have recently workedin the USA,Italy, Belgium, Germany and France.6\\nTRAININGDescription of the training prograrnme for the PhD student, to include: mechanisms for monitoring progress,availability oftaught courses, practice at presentations etc (1 side).Facultv Graduate School and trainingPostgraduate training in the Faculty of Biological Sciences is coordinated by a central FacultyGraduate Office. The Graduate School offers specific training courses on research techniques,experimental design and data assessment, research environment, use of IT and the businessenvironment. The university\\'s Staff and Department Development Unit offers a range oftraining courses in communication skills, interpersonal skills and personal effectiveness. Acomplete list of more than 50 training courses that are currently on offer can be found on theGraduate S chool Web page (http ://www.fbs.leeds. ac.uk/gradschooU).Monitoring student prosressStudents are selected on the basis of a CV, standard application forms and interviews with staffmembers and the Admission Tutor. Formal meetings between supervisor and the student takeplace once a month, with a written record that is filed centrally; the student prepares a report ofprogress, problems and future work, which is discussed with the supervisor and commentsadded. All students additionally have an academic staff advisor who is an independent, andconfidential, source of advice and guidance. Students register provisionally for the PhD degreeand progress is monitored by frequent informal meetings and by the monthly formal meetingsystem.Assessment of studentsDuring the flust year the student gives at least one poster or oral presentation. Project reports arewritten at 4 months and 9 months. The 9 months report is examined orally by a panel ofassessors, who on the basis of the report and viva decide about transfer to full PhD registration.ln years 2 and3 students give formal seminars that are assessed by two staff who providewritten feedback and advice. At the end of year 2 students prepare a further report including aplan for completing their thesis within 3 years. This is discussed with their supervisor andadvisor who provide appropriate feedback and advice. Industrial links have been established andas an example, some of the third year symposia are sponsored by Organon Ltd. who haveprovided prizes for the best oral presentations. All students are encouraged to submit theirthesis by the end of the third year. The University has an absolute 4 year submissionguillotine. Perhaps, not surprisingly, our completion rates are particularly high!Scientific developmentEach year, students will attend at least 10 research seminars glven by internal or externalspeakers. Attendance is recorded at seminars, courses and conferences in the sfudentsPersonal Profile folder throughout their 3 years. Students are encouraged to attend BBSRCGraduate Schools, national and international scientific conferences. Each year there is a prizecompetition in the Faculty sponsored by Novartis to provide funding for the winning studentto attend an international conference during their final year.Laboratory EnvironmentAs outlined above, previous work in this area has set up the assay systems in a way that willgreatly facilitate this new prograrnme of work. Since this is a laboratory largely devoted to thestudy of structure/function relationships of integral membrane proteins using recombinant DNAand protein chemical technologies, this project will be carried out in a very supportive andknowledgeable environment. It is appreciated that this is a large and in some parts veryambitious project and unlikely to be realised in full by a single PhD student.

With this objective Fight for Sight hascommitted ll3million over the past 5 years,Astburv centre for structural Molecular Bioloqv. Universitv of LeedsThe Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology (ACSMB) is an interdisciplinary researchcentre of the University of Leeds. lt was founded to carry out international quality research in allaspects of structural molecular biology, ACSMB brings together over fifty academic staff fromvarious faculties of the University of Leeds who share common interests. lt is named afterW.T,Astbury, a biophysicist who laid many of the foundations of the field during a long researchcareer at the University of Leeds (1928-1961). lt was Astbury who originally identified the twomajor recurring patterns of protein structure (alpha and beta), took the first fibre diffractionpictures of DNA (in 1938) and is widely credited with the definition of the field of molecularbiology.The ACSMB today continues this tradition and focuses on the determination of the atomicstructures of biological macromolecules using all of the major techniques (X-ray diffraction,nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron microscopy), ACSMB also specialises innew biophysical techniques such as measuring the mechanical folding properties of individualprotein molecules using atomic force microscopy. These studies are combined with analyses ofbiological function with the ultimate aim of understanding the molecular basis of life itself,\\nStructural molecular biology plays a pivotal role in modern biology, both in the fundamentalunderstanding of living things and in the design of new treatments for disease.The NeedRetinitis PiqmentosaRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the name given to a group of hereditary eye disorders affecting theretina, (the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye) in which the first stages of seeing takeplace, ln RP, sight loss is gradual but progressive.The retina serves a similar purpose to a film inside a camera. Light is focused by a lens at thefront of the camera onto a light-sensitive film at the back, to form a picture, ln a similar way, lightentering the eye is focused onto a light-sensitive tissue which lines the inside of the eye at theback. This tissue is the retina.The retina consists of two main layers, a thin one called the pigment epithelium and a thickerone, made up of many layers of cells, called the neural retina, One particular layer in this neuralretina contains many millions of cells (called photoreceptors) which are able to respond to light. Afew million cells called cones are concentrated in the central portion of the retina, These allow theeye to see fine detail and colour. Away from the central portion of the retina are about 120 millioncells, which are mostly rod cells. They enable us to see when light is dim and provide peripheralvision outside of the main line of sight, When light is focused onto these rods or cones, a smallelectrical charge is generated (the amount depends on the amount of light) and this chargepasses down the optic nerve to the brain. As each of these cells receives a slightly differentamount of light and sends a different electrical pulse, the brain is able to assemble a picture,It is now known that there are many different inherited defects causing RP, ln all RP-relatedconditions however, the ability of the retina to respond to light is affected. The problem can be inmany parts of the retina such as the rod or cone cells, or in the connections between the cells ofthe retina.The most common first symptom is difficulty in seeing in poor light, for example outdoors at dusk,or in a dimly lit room, A second symptom is reduction of the visual field, in which sight is lost fromthe sides, or from above and below. This is often referred to as tunnel vision and means that therod cells, and some of the outer cone cells, have been affected first. ln some RP-relatedconditions central vision is lost first, The first signs of this are difficulty in reading print or carryingout detailed work, All RP conditions are progressive, but the speed at which deterioration takesplace varies from one person to another, ln many types of RP, glare from bright lights is anincreasing problem, although some people do not experience this until the more advancedstages,\\nMutations in the rod disc protein \\'peripherin\\' have been shown to be associated with certainforms of RP, giving rise to retinal degeneration causing blindness. With previous support fromFight for Sight, the research group demonstrated the function of the protein and now thisresearch project will work to define the molecular basis for its function and to identify chemicalagents which may reverse the effects of these mutations, so providing the basis for developingpotential drug treatments.To help understand the mechanism of action of the protein in more detail, the research aims touncover the structure of key regions in the protein mainly responsible for this role and theimportance of specific amino acid residues for its form and function, This may also aid thediscovery of new drugs.Student stipendConsumablesFeesTravel awardOct 2004-2005e 11,500e5,000[3,044t500Oct 2005-2006t12,000[5,000t3,136t500Totalt20,0Mt20,636Total costs: t40,680Fight for Sight has pledged to give full financial support to this important project and the only waywe can do this is through fundraising activities and grants from charitable trusts such asYorkshie Building Society Charitable Foundation.The above budget indicates the amount required for each academic year, Below are theamounts required for shorter periods of the project:Average cost per day t56Average cost per week t391Average cost per month t1695Any suppott the Trustees can give for this vital research work will make a difference to theproject and could make a difference to the lives of those who suffer from Retinitis Pigmentosa -both now and in the future.\\n$qFight for SightAPPLICATION FOR A PhD STUDENTSHIP TO START OCTOBER 2OO31.
